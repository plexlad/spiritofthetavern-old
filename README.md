 * All values in configuration will be able to be modified using Discord commands by admins.
 * Quiet Time. Disables all channels except for `channelExceptions` during specified `times`.
 * Fully configured Tavern roleplay handling to make moderators lives easier!

Programming Features:
 * Uses a custom made Discord framework to allow for modular commands and features.

## Getting Started (for developers)
There are some features that make development very nice and extremely convenient.

### Commands
To add a new slash command, create a new javascript file in the commands folder. The name does not matter, but is defined with the `data` value.

The new command requires some values in `module.exports`:
 * `data`: A slash command builder that is used by the client.
 * `execute(interaction, client)`: A function that is called when the slash command is called. The client is the original used in your `index.js`, so it will keep all of the assigned variables.
 * `preconditions`: An array that is used for preconditions (check below). Not required.

### Preconditions
Preconditions are used to add special filters to commands by using a function to take data from the client and interaction and returning `true` or `false`. To get started, create a new javascript file in the preconditions folder. The name on this one is important, as there is no `data` attribute. 

The precondition requires a value in `module.exports`:
 * `check(interaction, client)`: This is a function that runs when a precondition when called. Return `true` if you want the the command to go through, false if you want an error message.

### Scripts
Scripts are your event handlers! There are not many functions right now, but more are to be added later! In order to start, create a new javascript file in the scripts folder. In `module.exports`, you can create any of the entries below. all are functions that are run during certain events.

 * `ready(client)`: Event "ready".
