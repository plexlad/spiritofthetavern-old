# Spirit of the Tavern
Discord bot for the Snow College table top gaming community.

## Getting Started
This is a moderation bot with basic features. To start, download this package and run `src/index.js`. To configure, change values in `config.json`. To see what the configuration does or to see what developers should do, check below.

Normal Features:
 * All values in configuration will be able to be modified using Discord commands by admins.
 * Quiet Time. Disables all channels except for `channelExceptions` during specified `times`.
 * Fully configured Tavern roleplay handling to make moderators lives easier!

Programming Features:
 * Uses a custom made Discord framework to allow for modular commands and features.
 * Add a command using the commands folder!
 * Supports other features, including script triggers and preconditions. 

### Configuration (src/config.json)
 * `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your discord bot token.
 * `roles`: The IDs of the specified roles. Used for permission.
 	* `mod`: Values for the moderator role.
	* `admin`: Values for the admin role.
 * `quietTime`: Configuration options for the quiet time feature.
 	* `channelExceptions`: The IDs of the guild channels exempted from quiet time.
	* `times`: Sets of arrays with the assigned quite time values. In format [[starTime, endTime], ...]. Time segments can be unlimited.

## Getting Started (for developers)
There are some features that make development very nice and extremely convenient.

### Commands
To add a new slash command, create a new javascript file in the commands folder. The name does not matter, but is defined with the `data` value.

The new command requires some values in `module.exports`:
 * `data`: A slash command builder that is used by the client.
 * `execute(interaction, client)`: A function that is called when the slash command is called. The client is the original used in your `index.js`, so it will keep all of the assigned variables.
 * `preconditions`: An array that is used for preconditions (check below). Not required.

### Preconditions
Preconditions are used to add special filters to commands by using a function to take data from the client and interaction and returning `true` or `false`. To get started, create a new javascript file in the preconditions folder. The name on this one is important, as there is no `data` attribute. 

The precondition requires a value in `module.exports`:
 * `check(interaction, client)`: This is a function that runs when a precondition when called. Return `true` if you want the the command to go through, false if you want an error message.
